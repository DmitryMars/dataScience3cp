# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

The goal of this project is to create a tidy data set for the UCI HAR Dataset.  
You can download initial dataset here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

Unzip it into folder with run_analysis.R, set working directory to that folder and run the script.  
After processing you will get a tidy_results.txt file.
